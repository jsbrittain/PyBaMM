# Expression implementations

`Expressions.hpp` is a convenience header for importing the abstract base class. The base class should be overridden by implementation classes providing expression evaluations. For instance, the `Casadi` folder contains concrete classes inheriting from `Base/*` (see implementation files for specifics).
